# Instructions  
 Using the cout and cin statements and two string variables, write a program that prompts the user to input a first name then prompts the user to input a last name. Use good style and descriptive names such as

string firstName, lastName;

Output a statement which says "Welcome to C++ programming, <first name> <lastname>. I applaud your choice to learn to code and increase your technical skills."

Option: Instead of cin, you may wish to use getline which allows the user to input a string with a space in it. If you use getline, then only one variable is needed  such as

string fullName;

Be sure to comment your code with 4 lines at the top (your name, which class you are taking (CIS-5 Online), the date, the assignment name with a brief description of the program) such as:

// Your Name

//CIS-5 Online (or Hybrid)

// Today's Date

// Lab 2C: Full Name - The program accepts the user's name from the keyboard and displays a message to the user.

Submit the Assignment to let me know you are finished.
